Payroll Systems
Created by Bijay Khanal, Jay Trivedi, Jack Tucker

We want to do a payroll system for a company where we store employee information such as salary, hours worked, overtime pay, taxes and deductions, performance bonuses, position in the company, and department.

We will need payroll calculation, time tracking, and employee management so that we can add/delete employees.
